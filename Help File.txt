INSTALLATION : ERRORS
Two methods to run our prototype. (We ensure privacy at all cost) .
In case you have access to the repo, assuming that you have accepted the invite, you can clone directly; And in case you have the zip file, you can extract it.  Let's see how to use both methods;

This is a node Js Project and will assume that you have Node installed.

âœ¨ From GitHub: (Accept the collab invite)
Run the following commands in your terminal;

1. "git clone https://github.com/MpaMpeUg/mpampe-alpha.git"
2. "cd mpampe-alpha" to locate package.json file
3. Run "npm install"

After all node modules have been installed; (Internet is required) 
To Start local server ðŸš€

4. Run "npm start"
5. Visit "http://localhost:3000/" in your fav browser ðŸš€

You don't need to run the npm fund command... You can also ignore deprecation and warning errors. 
We have set our default server to run on port 3000.

âœ¨ From ZIP
1. Extract to your favorite folder/name
2. Change the directory to the root folder to locate the package.json file: "cd mpampe-alpha"
3. Repeat steps 3-5 above.

In case of ERRORS
First Try; "npm cache clean"
OR; "npm cache clean --force" to force.

If you encounter errors due to the Node version defined in package-lock.json, manually delete it and run npm install again.
Also, make sure Port 3000 is not in use already before you run npm start
